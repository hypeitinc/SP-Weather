# SP-Weather
SP Weather forecast joomla module

This is forked from https://github.com/JoomShaper/SP-Weather.
That repository was not up-to-date for whatever reason so I updated from v2.2.3 to v2.3 as available on the Joomshaper website.

Then there was also a problem with the module stripping out <spaces> from the location string you enter.
Openweathermap.org does not like that and return unknown location. This issue has been fixed.
